Final Project README

In this README, we will describe how to run each of the models described in our report. Each can be run on the student machines, but they require the updated version of Python found in Dr. Chiang's public folder.

Baseline
--------

FILL IN


Naive Bayes Vocabulary Model
----------------------------

Unigram model: naive_bayes_class_return_probs.py
Bigram model: naive_bayes_bigrams_class_return_probs.py

These two files are very similar; both contain the naive_bayes class, which has all of the logic for training and decoding. Both files have a main routine that runs the model on the testing data and determines the accuracy, so these files can be run directly to see those results. The training and testing files are lines in the file, for simplicity.


Logistic Regression Vocabulary Model
------------------------------------

FILL IN


Part of Speech Tagger
---------------------

pos_tagger class: pos_tagger_class.py
To test accuracy: pos_tester.py

The part of speech tagger class is found in pos_tagger_class.py. This class contains all of the logic for training and decoding. The accuracy of the tagger is tested by running "python pos_tester.py": this file tests the accuracy of the POS tagger itself and the tag n-gram classifier, described below.


Naive Bayes Tag n-grams Model
-----------------------------

Class: pos_classifier_4grams_return_probs.py
To test accuracy: run pos_classifier_4grams_return_probs.py, which uses the annotated tags
		  run pos_tester.py, which uses our POS tagger
			

The naive Bayes classifier using tag n-grams is found in pos_classifier_4grams_return_probs.py. The main routine in this file tests the pure accuracy of the classifier, using the annotated tags instead of the POS tagger that we built. The classifier is used with our tagger in pos_tester.py.


Removing Single Word Posts
--------------------------

FILL IN


Combined Bag of Words: Vocabulary and POS
-----------------------------------------

Class: naive_bayes_combined.py
To test accuracy: combined_tester.py

The two bags of words (for vocabulary and tag n-grams) are combined in naive_bayes_combined.py. Running "python combined_tester.py" will give the results on the testing data.


Linear Regression
-----------------

To test accuracy: linear_regression_classifier.py

This file uses the naive Bayes vocabulary model and the tag n-gram model to determine and overall classification.

Cross-Validation
